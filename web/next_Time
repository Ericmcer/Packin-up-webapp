Hey eric great work hehehee

Uhh it works for the most part but looks like shit. Need to display a signpost at top that has needs and add/remove functionality
and a save changes button that will send data back to servlet
background image is too short
icons for backpacks are too big and kinda pointless with buttons, after it all works possible reconfigure so backpacks are clicked on 
to call showContents(event)
add/remove item buttons on backpacks
