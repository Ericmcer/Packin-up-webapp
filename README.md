Packin-up-webapp
================

Web application to coordinate a backpacking trip. Allows users to create a group and add or remove stuff from backpacks.
Could use to see who is bringing what and what is needed.

Runs on an apache tomcat server. Made with Java, Servlets, Jsps, and MYSQL on backend. Used JQuery and bootstrap on 
client side.

Problems: I could have optimized the DBOperations class alot more. Was working on a deadline though So this is the 
totally functional but not optimal version.
